Within this lab report, I'll introduce three code changes that in my group in order to fix a bug.
* A screenshot of the code change 
* Link to the test file for a failure-inducing input
* The symptom of that failure-inducing input
* Relationship between the bug, the symptom, and the failure-inducing input
